A free and easy (get it?) way to take Stripe payments on your website!

== Description ==

There are a bunch of Stripe plugins out there that either require you to pay for features or require you to set up an account with a third party. Not here! This one is 100% free and easy to use.

== Installation ==

Visit the settings page to enter your Stripe API keys, upload your logo and set your company name and currency.

Then add the following shortcode to your page:

> [freezy_stripe name="My Product" price="99.99"]

You can also put in multiple prices to generate a dropdown list for your customers to choose from:

> [freezy_stripe name="My Donation" price="5,10,15,20,25,50,100"]
